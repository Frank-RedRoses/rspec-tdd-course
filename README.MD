# rspec-tdd-course
Personal repository on learning how to code with TDD on Ruby and the RSpec Gem.

The main goal is to master the syntax and structure of RSpec, along with test-driven development principles to design and implement clean test specs in Ruby.

## Course content
Testing Ruby with RSpec course begins with the RSpec essentials and proceeds to more complex topics including:

- Installation
- Project Initialization
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- let variables
- before and after Hooks
- Subjects
- Shared Examples
- Shared Context
- Built-in Matchers
- Mocks and Doubles
- Instance Doubles
- Class Doubles


## Course goals
- Master the syntax and structure of RSpec, the most popular Ruby Gem for testing
- Utilize test-driven development principles to design and implement clean test specs in Ruby
- Explore the wide collection of RSpec matchers available to test your code
- Reduce dependencies in your test suite by mocking objects with class and instance doubles
